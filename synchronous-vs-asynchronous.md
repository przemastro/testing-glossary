# Synchronous vs Asynchronous

**Synchronous** - executing operations one after another. The second waits for the first to complete.  
**Asynchronous** - executing operations concurrently. In Java, this is multithreading, in TypeScript/JavaScript it’s promises, `async/await`.

| **Feature**                | **Synchronous Operations**                                | **Asynchronous Operations**                                         |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution Order**         | Code executes line by line.                               | Code may continue execution before the operation finishes.          |
| **Blocking**                | Blocks the main thread until the operation completes.      | Does not block – the code continues execution.                      |
| **Performance**             | Slower, as it waits for the operation to complete.         | Faster, as it can handle multiple operations simultaneously.        |
| **Use Cases**               | Simple applications, e.g., calculators.                    | Network operations, data fetching, file operations.                 |
