javascript

    await page.waitForSelector('button#submit', { state: 'visible' });

### 23. **How do you handle situations where an element is dynamically generated in Playwright?**
**Answer:**

### 24. **How do you perform cross-browser testing with Playwright?**
**Answer:**  
You can perform cross-browser testing by configuring Playwright to run on different browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit). You simply need to specify the desired browser when launching the test:

### 26. **How do you run tests on multiple devices with Playwright?**
**Answer:**  
Playwright allows running tests on multiple devices by creating multiple contexts and launching the tests simultaneously:

javascript

    const { devices } = require('playwright');
    const iphone = devices['iPhone 11'];
    const context1 = await browser.newContext({ ...iphone });
    const context2 = await browser.newContext();

### 27. **How do you debug tests in Playwright?**
**Answer:**  
You can debug Playwright tests by using the --debug flag or pausing the test execution with await page.pause() to inspect the state of the browser. You can also use console.log() or the Playwright Inspector for better insights.

### 28. **How do you implement retries for failed tests in Playwright?**
**Answer:**  
You can implement retries for failed tests by using the retries option in the test configuration:

javascript

    module.exports = {
      retries: 2
    };

### 29. **How do you handle browser crashes or exceptions in Playwright?**
**Answer:**  
You can handle browser crashes or exceptions by using try-catch blocks in your tests or by listening to the browser.on('disconnected') event to handle unexpected crashes and reconnect or restart the browser.

### 30. **How do you manage test data for Playwright tests?**
**Answer:**  
Test data management in Playwright can be achieved by using mock data, creating separate test environments, or setting up initial conditions before each test using beforeEach() hooks. You can also seed databases or interact with APIs to set up test data before running the tests.
