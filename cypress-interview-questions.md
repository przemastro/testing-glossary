## Cypress Interview Questions
### Easy Questions:
1. What is Cypress?

 - Cypress is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework built for modern web applications. It is known for its fast, reliable testing capabilities and its ability to run directly in the browser.

2. How do you install Cypress?

 > npm install cypress --save-dev

3. How do you open the Cypress Test Runner?

 > npx cypress open

4. How do you write a simple test in Cypress?

 > describe('My First Test', () => {
it('Visits the Cypress documentation page', () => {
cy.visit('https://www.cypress.io')
cy.contains('Documentation').click()
cy.url().should('include', '/documentation')
})
})

5. How do you select an element by class in Cypress?

 > cy.get('.className')

6. How do you select an element by ID in Cypress?

 > cy.get('#elementId')

7. How do you perform a click operation in Cypress?

 > cy.get('#buttonId').click()

8. How do you type text into an input field in Cypress?

 > cy.get('#inputField').type('Hello World')

9. How do you check if an element contains specific text in Cypress?

 > cy.get('#elementId').should('contain', 'Expected Text')

10. How do you run Cypress tests from the command line?

 > npx cypress run

11. What does 'require' in javascript?

 - In JavaScript, particularly in Node.js environments, require is a function used to include modules (both built-in and external) in your application. It allows you to import functionality from other files or packages, enabling code modularization and reuse.

12. What are the plugins file responsibilities?

 - Extend Cypress Functionality

13. What are the support file responsibilities?

 - Global Configuration and Behavior, Set up global hooks

14. What is 'describe' block?

 - The describe block is used to group related tests together. It defines a test suite, allowing you to logically organize your tests.  It typically contains one or more it blocks (test cases) and can also contain nested describe blocks for further sub-grouping.

15. What is mocha?

 - Mocha is a test runner that provides a way to structure your tests with describe and it blocks.

### Moderate Questions:
1. How do you handle assertions in Cypress?

 > cy.get('#elementId').should('have.text', 'Expected Text')
cy.get('#elementId').should('be.visible')
cy.get('#inputField').should('have.value', 'Input Value')

2. How do you handle dropdowns in Cypress?

 > cy.get('#dropdownId').select('OptionText')

3. How do you interact with checkboxes and radio buttons in Cypress?

 > cy.get('#checkboxId').check()
cy.get('#radioButtonId').check()

4. How do you handle alerts in Cypress?

 > cy.on('window:alert', (text) => {
expect(text).to.contains('Alert text')
})
cy.get('#alertButton').click()

5. How do you handle iframes in Cypress?

 > cy.frameLoaded('#iframeId')
cy.iframe().find('#elementInIframe').click()

6. How do you wait for an element to be visible in Cypress?

 > cy.get('#elementId', { timeout: 10000 }).should('be.visible')

7. How do you perform a drag-and-drop operation in Cypress?

 > cy.get('#dragElement').trigger('mousedown', { which: 1 })
cy.get('#dropArea').trigger('mousemove').trigger('mouseup', { force: true })

8. How do you handle file uploads in Cypress?

 > const filePath = 'path/to/file.txt'
cy.get('input[type="file"]').attachFile(filePath)

9. How do you take a screenshot in Cypress?

 > cy.screenshot()

10. How do you mock network requests in Cypress?

 > cy.server()
cy.route('GET', '/api/endpoint', 'fixture:data.json').as('getData')
cy.visit('/page')
cy.wait('@getData')
  
11. Sync vs Async operations and testing

Understanding synchronous and asynchronous operations is crucial for effective testing, especially in JavaScript, where asynchronous operations are common. Let's break down the concepts and how different testing frameworks handle them.

Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Operations

#### Synchronous Operations:

 - Execute sequentially, one after the other.
 - Each operation waits for the previous one to complete before starting.
 - Blocking, meaning the execution stops at each step until the current operation is done.

> console.log('Start');
console.log('Middle');
console.log('End');

#### Asynchronous Operations:

 - Execute independently of the main program flow.
 - Operations can start before previous ones complete.
 - Non-blocking, meaning the execution can move on to other tasks while waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete.

> console.log('Start');
setTimeout(() => console.log('Middle'), 1000);
console.log('End');
 
#### Asynchronous Testing

Asynchronous testing involves writing tests that can handle asynchronous operations like network requests, timers, and file I/O. Testing frameworks handle these operations differently.

Testing Frameworks: Async vs. Sync

Mocha

   Asynchronous Testing:

   - Mocha provides several mechanisms to handle asynchronous operations, including callbacks, promises, and async/await.

Example:

Using Callbacks:

 > it('should fetch data with callback', function(done) {
fetchData((data) => {
assert.equal(data, 'expectedData');
done();
});
});

Using Promises:

 > it('should fetch data with promise', function() {
return fetchData().then((data) => {
assert.equal(data, 'expectedData');
});
});

Using Async/Await:

 > it('should fetch data with async/await', async function() {
const data = await fetchData();
assert.equal(data, 'expectedData');
});
 
Cypress

   Asynchronous Testing:

   - Cypress abstracts much of the complexity of asynchronous testing by automatically waiting for commands and assertions to complete.


 > describe('Asynchronous Operations in Cypress', () => {
it('should handle async operations', () => {
cy.visit('/page');
cy.get('button').click();  // Assumes button click triggers an async operation
cy.get('.result').should('contain', 'Expected Result');
});
});

12. Callbacks

 - A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function. It is executed after the completion of a specific task or operation.

13. Promises

 - A promise is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

14. Async/Await

 - Async/await is a modern syntax for working with asynchronous code in JavaScript. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous-looking manner.

### Difficult Questions:
1. How do you implement custom commands in Cypress?

 > Cypress.Commands.add('login', (username, password) => {
cy.get('#username').type(username)
cy.get('#password').type(password)
cy.get('#loginButton').click()
})

2. How do you handle retries in Cypress?

 - Cypress automatically retries assertions until they pass or the timeout is reached. You can customize the retry behavior using Cypress.config.

3. How do you use Cypress with Continuous Integration (CI) tools like Jenkins?

 > npx cypress run --record --key <record-key>

4. How do you perform parallel test execution in Cypress?

 - Cypress supports parallel test execution through its Dashboard service, which distributes tests across multiple CI machines.

5. How do you handle dynamic elements in Cypress?

 > cy.get('.dynamic-element').should('exist')

6. How do you perform visual testing with Cypress?

 - Use plugins like cypress-image-snapshot to perform visual regression testing.
 > cy.get('#element').toMatchImageSnapshot()

7. How do you debug tests in Cypress?

 - Use cy.debug() and browser developer tools to set breakpoints and inspect test execution.

8. How do you handle multiple domains in Cypress?

 - Cypress does not support multiple domain visits in a single test due to its security model. However, you can stub network requests to simulate interactions with multiple domains.

9. How do you manage test data and environment variables in Cypress?

 - Use cypress.json for global configuration and environment variables. Use Cypress.env to access environment variables.
 > // cypress.json
{
"env": {
"username": "user1",
"password": "pass1"
}
}

 > // In tests
const username = Cypress.env('username')
const password = Cypress.env('password')

10. How do you handle flaky tests in Cypress?

 - Use retries, improve test isolation, and ensure that tests do not depend on external factors or shared state. Use cy.intercept to stub network requests and make tests more predictable.
