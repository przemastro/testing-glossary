1. What is Python and why is it popular for QA automation?

 - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's popular for QA automation due to its extensive libraries, frameworks like Selenium and PyTest, and its ability to handle different testing requirements efficiently.

2. How do you install a Python package?

 - You can install a Python package using the pip command. For example, pip install selenium.

3. What is a list in Python and how do you create one?

 - A list in Python is an ordered collection of items that can be of different types. You create a list using square brackets, e.g., my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b'].
How do you write a simple function in Python?

 > def greet(name):
return f"Hello, {name}!"

4. What is the difference between append() and extend() methods in Python lists?

 - append() adds its argument as a single element to the end of a list, while extend() iterates over its argument adding each element to the list, extending the list.

5. How do you handle exceptions in Python?

 > try:
 '#' Code that may raise an exception
 except SomeException as e:
 '#' Code that runs if the exception occurs

6. What is a dictionary in Python?

 - A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. You can create a dictionary using curly braces, e.g., my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}.

7. How do you check if a key exists in a dictionary?

 - You can check if a key exists in a dictionary using the in keyword, e.g., 'key1' in my_dict.

8. What is a tuple and how does it differ from a list?

 - A tuple is similar to a list but is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed after it is created. Tuples use parentheses, e.g., my_tuple = (1, 2, 3).

9. How do you read a file in Python?

 > with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
content = file.read()

10. What are Python decorators?

 - Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods. They are often used to add functionality to functions or methods in a reusable way.

11. How do you install Selenium for Python?

 - You can install Selenium for Python using pip install selenium.

12. How do you create a virtual environment in Python?

 - You create a virtual environment using python -m venv env_name, and activate it using source env_name/bin/activate on Unix or env_name\Scripts\activate on Windows.

13. What is a lambda function in Python?

 - A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. It can take any number of arguments but has a single expression, e.g., lambda x: x + 1.

14. What is the purpose of __init__.py in Python packages?

 - The __init__.py file indicates that the directory it's in should be treated as a package. It can also execute initialization code for the package.

15. How do you perform a HTTP GET request using Python?

 > import requests
response = requests.get('http://example.com')
print(response.text)

16. How do you convert a string to a list of characters in Python?

 - You can convert a string to a list of characters using list(string), e.g., list('hello') results in ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'].

17. What is the difference between remove() and pop() methods in a list?

 - remove() removes the first occurrence of a value, while pop() removes an element at a given index and returns it. If no index is specified, pop() removes and returns the last item.

18. What is a set in Python?

 - A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are defined using curly braces, e.g., my_set = {1, 2, 3}.

19. How do you find the length of a list in Python?

 - You can find the length of a list using the len() function, e.g., len(my_list).

### Moderate Level Questions
1. What is the difference between == and is in Python?

 - == checks for equality of values, while is checks for identity, meaning it checks if two references point to the same object.

2. How do you perform unit testing in Python?

 - You can use the unittest module in Python for unit testing. Example:

class TestMath(unittest.TestCase):
def test_add(self):
self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)
if __name__ == '__main__':
unittest.main()

3. What are list comprehensions in Python?

4. How do you handle command-line arguments in Python?

 - You can handle command-line arguments using the argparse module. Example:

5. import argparse

 > parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--name', help='Your name')
args = parser.parse_args()
print(f"Hello, {args.name}!")

6. How do you connect to a database in Python?

 - You can use libraries like sqlite3 for SQLite or pymysql for MySQL. Example with SQLite:

 > import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users')
results = cursor.fetchall()
conn.close()

> import some_module
def new_method(self):
pass
some_module.SomeClass.method = new_method

12. How do you serialize and deserialize objects in Python?

 - You can use the pickle module for serialization and deserialization.

 > import pickle
data = {'key': 'value'}
with open('data.pkl', 'wb') as f:
pickle.dump(data, f)
with open('data.pkl', 'rb') as f:
loaded_data = pickle.load(f)

13. How do you handle date and time in Python?

 - You can use the datetime module to handle date and time.

 > with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
content = file.read()

16. What is the @staticmethod decorator in Python?

 - @staticmethod defines a method that doesn't operate on an instance or class, but behaves like a plain function.

 > class MyClass:
@staticmethod
def my_static_method():
print("Static method")

17. How do you use assertions in Python?

 - You can use the assert statement to check for conditions. If the condition is False, it raises an AssertionError.

 > assert 1 + 1 == 2

18. What are Python docstrings?

 - Docstrings are string literals used to document modules, classes, methods, and functions.

> def my_function():
"""This is a docstring."""
pass

19. What is the difference between deepcopy and copy in Python?

 - copy.copy() creates a shallow copy of an object, while copy.deepcopy() creates a deep copy, meaning all objects are recursively copied.

 > import copy
shallow_copy = copy.copy(obj)
deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(obj)

20. How do you check for memory leaks in a Python application?

 - You can use tools like objgraph and guppy to check for memory leaks.

 > import objgraph
objgraph.show_growth()

21. What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python?

 - The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. This means that multi-threaded Python programs can't fully exploit multi-core processors.

### Difficult Level Questions
1. Explain the concept of metaclasses in Python.

 - Metaclasses are classes of classes that define how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass. You can define a metaclass by inheriting from type and overriding methods like __new__ and __init__.

2. How do you implement multithreading and multiprocessing in Python?

 - For multithreading, use the threading module. For multiprocessing, use the multiprocessing module.

 > import threading
import multiprocessing

3. What is a coroutine in Python, and how do you use async and await?

 - Coroutines are a type of generator that can be paused and resumed. Use async to define a coroutine and await to yield control back to the event loop.

4. async def my_coroutine():
await asyncio.sleep(1)

5. How do you handle memory management in Python?

 - Python handles memory management automatically using reference counting and garbage collection. However, you can manage memory using modules like gc for explicit garbage collection control.

6. What is the purpose of the super() function in Python?

 - super() allows you to call methods from a parent class, especially useful in multiple inheritance to ensure proper method resolution order.

 > class Child(Parent):
def method(self):
super().method()

7. Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution in Python.

 - Synchronous execution waits for each task to complete before starting the next one. Asynchronous execution allows tasks to run concurrently, using asyncio for non-blocking operations.

8. How do you optimize the performance of a Python application?

 - Optimize by profiling with cProfile, using efficient algorithms and data structures, leveraging built-in functions, minimizing global variable usage, and using libraries like NumPy for numerical computations.

9. What are Python descriptors and how are they used?

 - Descriptors are objects that define how attribute access is managed in a class using methods like __get__, __set__, and __delete__.
 
 > class Descriptor:
def __get__(self, instance, owner):
return 'value'

10. How do you create and handle custom exceptions in Python?

 > class CustomError(Exception):
pass
try:
raise CustomError("An error occurred")
except CustomError as e:
print(e)

11. Explain the concept of decorators and provide an example of a class method decorator.

 - Decorators modify the behavior of a function or class method. A class method decorator is defined with @classmethod.
 > class MyClass:
@classmethod
def my_class_method(cls):
print("Class method")

12. How do you manage dependencies in a Python project?

 - Use pip for installing dependencies and requirements.txt for listing them. Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.

13. What is the purpose of the __slots__ declaration in Python?

 - __slots__ is used to declare a fixed set of attributes, saving memory by preventing the creation of __dict__ for instances.

 > class MyClass:
__slots__ = ['attr1', 'attr2']

14. Explain method resolution order (MRO) in Python.

 - MRO determines the order in which base classes are looked up when executing a method. Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the MRO.

15. How do you handle large data sets in Python?

 - Use libraries like pandas for efficient data handling, generators for lazy evaluation, and numpy for numerical operations.

16. What is the difference between staticmethod and classmethod?

 - staticmethod doesn't take any reference to the instance or class. classmethod takes a reference to the class as its first parameter.
 
> class MyClass:
@staticmethod
def static_method():
pass

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        pass

17. How do you profile a Python script?

 - Use the cProfile module to profile the script and identify performance bottlenecks.
 > import cProfile
cProfile.run('my_function()')

18. Explain the difference between deepcopy and copy in Python.

 - copy creates a shallow copy of an object, while deepcopy creates a deep copy, recursively copying all objects.
> import copy
shallow_copy = copy.copy(obj)
deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(obj)

19. What is the significance of the __enter__ and __exit__ methods in Python?

 - These methods are used in context managers to allocate and release resources precisely. The with statement calls these methods.
> class MyContext:
def __enter__(self):
return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        pass

20. How do you use the dataclasses module in Python?

> from dataclasses import dataclass
@dataclass
class MyClass:
attr1: int
attr2: str

21. Explain the asyncio event loop and how it's used in asynchronous programming.

 - The asyncio event loop runs asynchronous tasks and callbacks. You use async and await to define and execute coroutines.
> import asyncio
async def my_coroutine():
await asyncio.sleep(1)
asyncio.run(my_coroutine())
