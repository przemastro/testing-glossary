## Code Review Interview Questions 
### Easy:
1. Question: What is smelly code?

 - Smelly code refers to code that is poorly structured, hard to understand, or violates best practices, potentially leading to maintenance difficulties or bugs.

2. Question: What is a code comment?

 - A code comment is a human-readable explanation or annotation within the source code, intended to provide context, clarification, or documentation.

3. Question: What is a magic number in code?

 - A magic number is a hardcoded numerical value in the code without explanation, making it difficult to understand its purpose or significance.

4. Question: What is code duplication?

 - Code duplication refers to the presence of identical or very similar code fragments in multiple places within the codebase, which can lead to maintenance issues and inconsistencies.

5. Question: What is the DRY principle?

 - The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle is a software development principle advocating for the elimination of redundancy in code, promoting reusability and maintainability.

### Moderate:
1. Question: What is a code smell related to long methods?

 - Long methods are a code smell that indicates a method is doing too much and may be difficult to understand or maintain.

2. Question: What is a potential security issue with hardcoded passwords?

 - Hardcoded passwords pose a security risk as they can be easily discovered by attackers, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.

3. Question: What is a potential code smell related to inconsistent naming conventions?

 - Inconsistent naming conventions, such as using different naming styles or unclear variable names, can make the codebase difficult to understand and maintain.

4. Question: What is a potential security vulnerability related to SQL injection?

 - SQL injection is a security vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious SQL queries into an application, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the database or data leakage.

5. Question: What is a code smell related to large classes?

 - Large classes are a code smell that indicates a class has too many responsibilities or is overly complex, making it difficult to understand and maintain.

### Difficult:
1. Question: What is a potential security issue related to cross-site scripting (XSS)?

 - Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into a web application, which are then executed in the context of other users' browsers, leading to data theft or unauthorized actions.

2. Question: What is a code smell related to tight coupling between modules?

 - Tight coupling between modules is a code smell where modules or components are highly dependent on each other, making it difficult to modify or replace one without affecting the others.

3. Question: What is a potential security vulnerability related to insecure deserialization?

 - Insecure deserialization is a security vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate serialized data to execute arbitrary code or tamper with the application's logic, leading to remote code execution or data tampering.

4. Question: What is a code smell related to excessive nested control structures?

 - Excessive nested control structures, such as deeply nested loops or conditional statements, can indicate overly complex logic that is difficult to understand and maintain.

5. Question: What is a potential security issue related to sensitive data exposure?

 - Sensitive data exposure is a security issue where sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, is exposed to unauthorized parties due to improper handling or storage.
